<br>This is a running engagement between fleets. One fleet is giving chase to another.
<br><b>(S0.1) NUMBER OF PLAYERS:</b> 2; the Attacking player and the Defending player.
<br><b>(S0.2) INITIAL SET UP</b>
<br><b>TERRAIN:</b> Any sector-wide terrain affects the whole map.
<br><b>ATTACKER:</b> Each unit within 3 hexes of 1115, facing the attacker's choice of B or C. WS-II, speed max. The attacker sets up after the defender. The attacker may start at WS-III if they have a scout unit. If every unit of the attacker has the campaign "Stealth" trait, then the defender starts at one WS level lower.
<br><b>DEFENDER:</b> Each unit within 3 hexes of 3116, facing the defender's choice of B or C. WS-II, speed max. The defender may start at WS-III if they have a scout unit. If every unit of the defender has the campaign "Stealth" trait, then the attacker starts at one WS level lower.
<br><b>YEAR:</b> Use the current year of the campaign. This will define the availability of refits, drone speeds, and other items.
<br><b>(S0.3) LENGTH OF SCENARIO:</b> The scenario continues until all forces belonging to one side have been destroyed, captured, or have disengaged.
<br><b>(S0.4) SPECIAL RULES</b>
<br><b>(S0.41) MAP:</b> The map will float. Any unit that has disengaged, cannot return. All units can disengage from any map edge.
<br><b>(S0.42) SHUTTLES AND PFs:</b> All shuttles and PFs have warp booster packs and all shuttles are advanced types it the year selected allows their use.
<br><b>(S0.421)</b> MRS shuttles may be purchased [up to the limits in J8.5)] under (S0.431).
<br><b>(S0.422)</b> If using EW fighters, use the standard deployment patterns (one EWF for each squadron of eight or more Ô¨Åghters) for EW fighters.
<br><b>(S0.423)</b> PFs may appear in this scenario if used by either player.
<br><b>(S0.43) COMMANDER'S OPTION ITEMS</b>
<br><b>(S0.431)</b> Each ship can purchase additional or special equipment as Commander's Option items (e.g., T-bombs, extra marines, etc.) up to 20% of its Combat BPV.
<br><b>(S0.432)</b> Drone speeds will depend on the year selected for the scenario.
<br>Each drone-armed ship can purchase special drones up to the historical racial percentages as part of the Commander's Option Items. Note that (S3.2) allows drone ships extra points for this purpose.
<br><b>(S0.433)</b> If players wish to use the optional rules for Prime Teams (G32.0), each player may have one such team at the cost of 25 Commander's Option points.
<br><b>(S0.44)</b> REFITS are available depending on the year selected.
<br><b>(S0.5) VICTORY CONDITIONS:</b> Victory only depends on who holds the field at the end of the battle. A player who still has ships (not shuttles or PFs) on the map and all forces belonging to the opposing player have been destroyed, captured, or have disengaged, is the winner of the encounter.
<br><b>(S0.6) VARIATIONS:</b> There is no situation where the scenario can be played under different conditions.
<br><b>(S0.7) BALANCE:</b> There are no options where the scenario can be balanced between players of different skill levels.
